    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Tacos make for a cheap and practical meal, they are easy to cook and you can fill them with almost anything.</p>
    <p>Chicken might strike you as a simple filling, but it's not as commonly found in Mexico as you might think. The key to making great chicken tacos is all in the seasoning, so we recommend that you use this recipe as a guideline but feel free to adjust the quantities of spices and chili to your liking.</p>
