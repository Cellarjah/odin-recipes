        <li>1/4 cup finely shredded parmesan cheese (1 oz)</li>
        <li>20 slices pepperoni (I recommend turkey, it's just as good as the regular)</li>

        <li>Red pepper flakes , for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the pizza dough:</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, combine yeast, 2 tsp sugar and 1/2 cup warm water and whisk until yeast has dissolved. Allow to rest 5 minutes. Add in remaining 1 cup warm water, olive oil, salt and vinegar. Fit mixer with whisk attachment, set on low speed and slowly add in 1 3/4 cups of the flour and mix until combined. </li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, heat the oil over medium in a non-stick pan and cook the chopped onion until transparent.</li>
        <li>For the pizza sauce:</li>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Preferably let rest 30 minutes (while dough is rising) to allow flavors to meld</li>
        <li>To assemble pizza:</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in oven and preheat oven to 450 degrees. While oven preheats assemble pizza. Punch down pizza dough (divide into two equal 16 oz portions, freeze one in a resealable bag for a later use or make 2 pizzas right away). Place a sheet of parchment paper over a pizza peel, then lightly dust parchment paper with flour. Pat/roll and stretch dough on pizza peel to a 13-inch round, while creating a rim along edge of dough. </li>
        <li>Using a fork (without piercing all the way through) pierce dough many times over surface. In a small bowl stir together 1 Tbsp olive oil with 1 clove garlic and brush evenly over top and edges of pizza, then evenly spread about 2/3 cup of the pizza sauce over pizza (leaving rim uncoated). </li>
        <li>Top evenly with cheeses (again leaving rim uncoated) and pepperoni slices (if using turkey pepperoni, I recommend adding halfway through baking). Carefully slide pizza (on parchment paper) to preheated pizza stone in oven and bake 12 - 15 minutes until crust is golden. Remove from oven, sprinkle top with oregano and optional red pepper flakes. Cut into slices and serve.</li>
    </ol>
